- 👋 Hi, I’m @Lamer217
- 👀 I’m interested in changing my profession as I can not find a job in a field that I've graduated in and the WEB is my second passion.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JS as that is one of the fundamentals of the Front-End, that I think should be learnt first, in full, in order to become a master web dev.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ANYTHING, that I'm currently competent for, WHERE I COULD LEARN & PROGRESS. (Vanilla JS) 
- 📫 How to reach me (please do):
Email: males.public@gmail.com ;
