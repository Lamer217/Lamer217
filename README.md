- 👋 Hi, I’m @Lamer217
- 👀 I’m interested in changing my profession as I can not find a job in a field that I've graduated in.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML & CSS as those are the fundamentals of the Front-End which I have found to be the easyest entry point into the IT field.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ANYTHING WHERE I COULD LEARN & PROGRESS. 
- 📫 How to reach me (please do):
